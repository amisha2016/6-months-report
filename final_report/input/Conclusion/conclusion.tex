How to work like in group for development of software and how to apply juggaar(innovated) in softwares to get problem solved.\\
A great deal of things are learned while working on this project. The learning was not
limited to project only but the whole experience of working as a trainee under Dr. H.S. Rai
at TCC, developer at OpenSCAD and also as a mentor for Google Code In was immensely
educational. Working with the Open Source Community and a variety of people of different
age group, one is always challenged by the fundamental difference between classroom coaching
and real World experience. But such a challenge is exactly the purpose of six months training.\\
The whole experience of working on this project and contributing to a few others has been
very rewarding as it has given great opportunities to learn new things and get a firmer grasp on
already known technologies.\\
