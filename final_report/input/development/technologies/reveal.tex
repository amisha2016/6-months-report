Reveal-js is one of the framework of Javascript. This can be used for presentations purpose.\\
Now before going to reveal-md lets talk about some fundamental things.\\
What is a Markup language?\\
Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. HTML and Markdown  is an example of a widely known and used markup language.\\
Markdown is a lightweight Markup Language with simple plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. It is created by  John Gruber. It had '.md' or '.markdown' extention.\\
"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion software tool written in Perl for web writers."\\
Moreover, to enable markdown feature of reveal.js, we need reveal-md. The Markdown feature of reveal.js is awesome, and has an easy (and configurable) syntax to separate slides. Use three dashes surrounded by two blank lines.\\
