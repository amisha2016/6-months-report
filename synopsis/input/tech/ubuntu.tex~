\section{Ubuntu: An open source OS}
During my training, I also got familiar with a great and open source Operating System, Ubuntu. Firstly, it was quite difficult for a regular MS Windows user to port to Ubuntu. I did all of my project work using this vast operating system. 
Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment. It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others" or "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".\\

Ubuntu's goal is to be secure "out-of-the box". By default user's programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other user's files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes.\\
