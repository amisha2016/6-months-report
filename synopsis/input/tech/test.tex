%\section{Testing}
Testing a program consists of providing the program with a set of test inputs (or test cases) and
observing if the program behaves as expected. If the program fails to behave as expected, then the
conditions under which failure occurs are noted for later debugging and correction.


This project had been taken through rigorous test to fully found potential causes of error and system failure
and full focus have been given to cover all possible exceptions that can
occur and cause failure of the software.\\
As this project is based on intensive background process it have been taken care that if correct input are given then processing of user job can even continue or a least automatically restart even after server shuts down or even crash.

If user don't enter any input then it by default takes latitude and longitude 0 respectively and zom is also set with default value 15. We can default value also.

When we click on a link "Permalink" the current latitude and longitude become a default. On refreshing we get the same location.

OSM tile server
Test
 &  OSM installation script run by the user will make the system OSM server.
 & 1. Proper network connection	.\newline
 2. Minimum RAM space required is 2GB.
&  Execute the script file install\_osm.sh.
 & If localhost output map of the world then OSM server is installed.

Database
Test
& 1.Dumping the raw data to database.\newline
& 1. Proper database administration rights must be awarded.\newline
 2. The storage space must be sufficient.\newline
 & 1. Give the correct path of the raw data file.\newline
 2. All core processers should be free for easy dump.\newline
