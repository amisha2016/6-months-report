\section{Certificate Genertion System}

Apart from the major project i.e OSM I have done another project "Certificate Generation System".

Certificate Generation System is a portable application used to Generate Certificate for single candidate providing his/her details along with image,
As well as for Batch/Number of candidates by simply providing the CSV format file (containing details of every candidate) along with candidate images.

CSV(Character Separated File) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Files in the CSV format can be imported to and exported from programs that store data in tables, such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc.
