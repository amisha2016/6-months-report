\section{Constraints}
   
  The project  constraint, is any restriction that defines a project's limitations; the scope, for example, is the limit of what the project is expected to accomplish. 

The following are the main constraints while making your system an OSM server.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Minimum 2GB RAM:} The system requires minimum 2 GB RAM to compile mod\_tile and mapnik.
   
    \item \textbf{Core processors:} The number of core processors is directly dependent on the dumping the data into database. More the database more CPU processor. For downloading the world's data it requires all core processors.
   
    \item \textbf{Hard disk Memory:} OSM data take 30 GB to download the world's data. If the data is require for commercial use than fine else if require for developing than extract small amount of data.
   
   
\end{enumerate}
