\section{Conclusion}
The core of OpenStreetMap is a collection of map data which can be used for many different purposes. You can get a first idea browsing the world map on the main page of OpenStreetMap.\\\\
Because everybody can use OpenStreetMap's data with very few restrictions, many different third party services are built on OpenStreetMap's data. Much of the value of OpenStreetMap lies in this variety of services. Each one serves you different information, and each one does so in a different way. There is much more information available through these services which you can't see on the OpenStreetMap world map.\\\\
Aside from all above I got go know about various methods like -:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Threading the programs 
\item Embedding and using different tech in one software.
\item How to work like in group for development of software.
\item How to apply juggaar(innovated) in softwares to get problem solved. 
\end{enumerate}
