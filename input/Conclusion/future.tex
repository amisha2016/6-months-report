\section{Future Scope}
Openstreetmap is open source altenative to Google Maps.
There has been a lot of discussions on the mailing lists, forums, IRC and other channels about project's direction/strategy/future. Everyone has ideas what they would like to see in the project, what they like or not about it. This initiative is supposed to provide a simple (accessible to everyone) platform to record and further discuss these ideas, merge them into larger topics and prepare a plan for future actions.
We can add more features like improving the login functionality also.
