%\section{Testing}
Testing a program consists of providing the program with a set of test inputs (or test cases) and
observing if the program behaves as expected. If the program fails to behave as expected, then the
conditions under which failure occurs are noted for later debugging and correction.


This project had been taken through rigorous test to fully found potential causes of error and system failure
and full focus have been given to cover all possible exceptions that can
occur and cause failure of the software.\\
As this project is based on intensive background process it have been taken care that if correct input are given then processing of user job can even continue or a least automatically restart even after server shuts down or even crash.

If user don't enter any input then it by default takes latitude and longitude 0 respectively and zom is also set with default value 15. We can default value also.

When we click on a link "Permalink" the current latitude and longitude become a default. On refreshing we get the same location.
