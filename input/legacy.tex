Here is a reiteration of some of the technologies I have encountered,
browsed and learned:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf{Operating system}}: Ubuntu
\item {\bf{Languages used}}: php, HTML, javascript, and Markdown
\item {\bf{Framework}}: Reveal.js
\item {\bf{Database}}: Mysql, Postgresql
\item {\bf{Typesetting}}: LaTex
\item {\bf{Other Learnings}}:  Wordpress, How to search.\\
And these are all very precious lessons in themselves.
\end{itemize}
